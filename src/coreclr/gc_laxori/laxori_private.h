// A region is a run of aligned Immix blocks that one thread owns. Addresses in this structure are header addresses (the
// address of the object header, one word before the object pointer), like the spans of the engine.
//
// Invariant: a live object of a region lies inside one block. The Immix engine promotes and sweeps by block, and it looks at the
// block of the start of an object only. The space of the region that holds no live object is the list of gaps. A gap lies inside one
// block. It holds no object and is never parsed; it can have any size (also 8 or 16 bytes).
