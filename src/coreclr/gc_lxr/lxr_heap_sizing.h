// Port-specific. The Java LXR runs in the fixed heap that -Xms/-Xmx give, so its heap-full trigger makes the whole free
// heap the nursery. The .NET host has no such setting, so the collector must choose the Immix capacity. The capacity is
// what the heap-full trigger compares with, so it sets the number of collections.
//
// The rule has two parts:
//  * A nursery budget. It starts at the initial capacity and doubles at each heap-full collection (slow start) until it
//    reaches a cap. A program that allocates little never leaves its small heap. A program that allocates a lot reaches
//    the cap after a few collections. The cap is a share of physical memory, as the standard collector limits its
//    gen0 budget, and is bounded by a constant above which a larger nursery gains little.
//  * The mature live size. The capacity must hold it next to the nursery, so the target is live + budget. The live
//    size is measured after the lazy sweep of the previous pause (occupied blocks, without the free lines of reusable
//    blocks), not predicted from block counts.
// The target never lowers the capacity and never exceeds a share of the reservation. The rest of the reservation is
// the room that a pause borrows for its to-space (P17 S5b). A failed allocation can still grow the heap beyond the
// ceiling (LxrGcHeap::TryGrow).
