# Negative control for board-claims-check.ps1.
#
# A checker that has only ever printed PASS is indistinguishable from a checker that cannot
# fail. That is rule 59's defect, and board-check.ps1 reproduced it in its own first draft --
# contiguity was derived from the artifact, so deleting the highest rule left 1..N-1 perfect
# and the check green. This control perturbs the board and requires each claim to go red.
#
# Rule 73: every claim is perturbed with TWO DISTINCT payloads, never the same one twice. A
# single payload proves only that something failed; two distinguishable ones prove the check
# READ THE VALUE IT NAMES, because the output has to quote back the payload that arrived. A
# checker that failed everything unconditionally would pass a one-payload control.
#
# Rule 74: a control that observes PASS on a perturbed input cannot tell "the check passed"
# from "the perturbation never arrived". So each case asserts the perturbation landed in the
# fabricated board before the checker runs, and asserts the checker's output quotes it.
#
# The patterns are EXTRACTED FROM THE CHECKER rather than restated here. A control holding
# its own copy of the locators would drift from the checker it audits and would keep passing
# after the checker stopped matching anything -- the same objection check-prose-claims.py:11
# raises against a checker holding its own copy of a number.
#
# Hermetic: every run works on a copy under a fresh temp directory. The real board is opened
# read-only and never written.
