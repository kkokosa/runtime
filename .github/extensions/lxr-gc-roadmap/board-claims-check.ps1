# Verifies the board's quantified prose claims against the P0.5 artifacts they describe.
#
# Why this exists. board-check.ps1 has thirteen checks across contents, extent, subject and
# hygiene, and not one of them compares a SENTENCE to a NUMBER. It would pass a board whose
# every structural property was perfect and whose P0.6 directive told an implementer to code
# against a count that no longer held. That is not hypothetical here: the directive shipped
# "0 of 6 throughput-phase rows" where the set actually claimed was 69, and it was caught by
# re-reading rather than by any instrument. P0.5-baselines.md:941 names the same gap on the
# document side -- "Not one compared a *sentence* to a number" -- and check-prose-claims.py
# was written to close it there. This is that script's counterpart for the board.
#
# Design constraint, taken from check-prose-claims.py:11-14. Every expected value is DERIVED
# from the artifacts at run time and never written here as a constant. This file holds only
# the locator patterns, the predicates, and the paths. A checker holding its own copy of a
# number is a second place to be wrong, and it agrees with a stale board as readily as with
# a correct one.
#
# Each claim is checked at EVERY occurrence, not at one located sentence. The board repeats
# these figures between two and four times, which is the multi-site literal drift that
# verify-baselines.sh:10-11 forbids outright -- "never repeated as literals at several
# assertion sites, so two cannot drift from a third unnoticed". Prose cannot be de-duplicated
# the way a script's constants can, so the next best thing is to require every copy to agree
# with the derived value.
#
# A pattern that matches NOTHING fails. Rule 74: observing a pass on a perturbed input cannot
# distinguish "the check passed" from "the check never arrived", and a reworded sentence
# silently retires its own regex. The same guard applies to the populations -- an empty row
# set makes "all rows carry X" vacuously true, which this script's own first draft printed as
# "0 of 0" after reading `results` at the top level when the rows live under
# `checkpoints[].results`. A defaulted read is a non-arrival that returns a plausible value.
#
# Every claim prints the derived value, the located text and the comparison, per rule 26: a
# bare verdict hides a check that ran against the wrong thing.
