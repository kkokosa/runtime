/// <para>Induced collections are tracked separately because of a concrete confound found in P0.3. The
/// hsqldb p99 discrepancy between the two reference oracles was not an LXR mechanism difference at
/// all: hsqldb's memory watcher calls <c>System.gc()</c>, one oracle services it with a full
/// stop-the-world collection and the other has that path commented out. A .NET harness that let
/// <c>GC.Collect()</c> happen invisibly would reproduce exactly that confound, so induced collections
