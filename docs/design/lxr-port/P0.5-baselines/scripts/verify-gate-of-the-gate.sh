# The gate of the gate, for P0.5.
#
# verify-baselines.sh is the thing that decides whether this step's numbers are trustworthy, which
# makes it the one script whose own defects are invisible when it passes. P0.5's document described
# five perturbations and the failures they produced, but shipped no way to re-run them -- so an
# auditor had to reconstruct them by hand. That is a reproducibility regression against P0.4, which
# shipped verify-harness-control.sh. This closes it.
#
# Structure follows P0.4's control script deliberately:
#
#   A  clean extract of committed content, outside any worktree        -> expect PASS
#   B  five copies, each with exactly one thing perturbed              -> expect a specific FAIL
#   C  the untouched extract again                                     -> expect PASS
#
# A and C are not ceremony. A gate that ignored its argument, or that failed for an unrelated
# reason, would satisfy B while proving nothing; requiring PASS on either side of the perturbations
# is what makes a FAIL in between attributable to the perturbation.
#
# Each case states its expectation before running, and prints the exit code and the matched line it
# compared, because a control that reports only pass/fail is a control nobody can audit.
#
# Usage: verify-gate-of-the-gate.sh [repo-root]
# Exit:  0 all cases behaved as required, 1 at least one did not, 2 the harness could not be set up.
