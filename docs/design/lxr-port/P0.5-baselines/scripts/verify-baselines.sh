# P0.5 baseline verification gate.
#
# Audits the artifact it ships with. The root is derived from ${BASH_SOURCE[0]}, so this script always
# checks the tree it is part of; an explicit argument overrides. There is no absolute machine path
# anywhere in here - that is the defect that made P0.3's gate silently audit a different, mid-edit
# checkout, reporting a failure the committed tree did not have and equally able to report a pass it
# had not earned.
#
# Expected counts are DERIVED from the artifact, never repeated as literals at several assertion
# sites, so two cannot drift from a third unnoticed.
#
# The strongest check here, and the one that makes P0.5's raw-retention decision mean something:
# every published mean is RECOMPUTED from the committed per-invocation CSV and required to match the
# published JSON. A summary that cannot be re-analysed is not evidence; this makes that testable
# rather than asserted.
#
# A section that contributes zero checks must never read as a section that passed. Modes are chosen,
# never inferred.
#
# Usage: verify-baselines.sh [repo-root] (--results <dir> | --no-results)
#
#   --results <dir>   audit the checkpoint files under <dir>. Fails if there are none, because naming
#                     a directory is a claim that it holds results.
#   --no-results      deliberately audit the static artifact only. Prints DEGRADED and exits 3, so a
#                     caller that checks only for exit 0 cannot mistake it for a full audit.
#   neither           inferred from the committed results directory. If that yields nothing the gate
#                     REFUSES to run rather than quietly skipping.
#
# Note for callers: `set -e` around this script will kill the caller on the intentional exit 3.
